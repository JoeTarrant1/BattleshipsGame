## How To Run
Run the ``main.py`` file using an IDE or interpreter, there should be a link that is outputted. Click on the link, then in the browser, edit the url by adding "/placement" to the end in order to get to the placement screen. Now the game should be ready to play.

## Self Evaluation
I feel like this project has gone quite well. The first few functions at the start of the project were quite simple so didn't challenge me too much but as the project progressed to Flask implementation I found it more challenging. Despite this, I feel like I have learnt a lot about the basics of Flask and have delivered a decent working battleships game. If I were to do this project again, I think I would try to do the extention tasks because they would push me, and I would hopefully learn some new things.

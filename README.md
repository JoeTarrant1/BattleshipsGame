# Battleships Game

As one of our first coursework projects at Exeter we were given the two html template files and asked to create a functioning battleships game using the html files for the UI and Python for the game logic, using Flask to bridge the gap between the two. In the game you play agaist a computer controlled player that makes guesses on your ships. I enjoyed working on this project because I had never used Flask before so I was figuring out lots of new things, and it gave me a good insight into how the backend and frontend can communicate with each other to create a fully working program.
